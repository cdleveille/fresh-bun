# âš¡ fullstack-bun

Single-page web app project template curated for performance, developer experience, and type safety.

### ðŸ”§ Stack

- **Runtime & Tooling**: [Bun](https://bun.sh) (server runtime, package manager, script runner)

- **Server**: [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com) (server framework)

- **Type Safety**: [Eden](https://elysiajs.com/eden/overview) (end-to-end type safety)

- **Client**: [React](https://react.dev) (user interface) & [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) (dev server, bundler)

- **Client-Side Tools**:

  - [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) (client-side routing)
  - [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (async state management & caching)

- **Code Quality**:

  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) (type checking & safety)
  - [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) (linting, formatting)
  - [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) (git hooks)

### âœ¨ Features

- **100% Type-Safe API**: Full static type-safety between the server and client. See
- Server/client interaction is 100% type-safe. See [api.ts](https://github.com/cdleveille/fullstack-bun/blob/main/src/server/api.ts) and [useApi.ts](https://github.com/cdleveille/fullstack-bun/blob/main/src/client/hooks/useApi.ts) for simple HTTP and WebSocket examples.

- **Automatic API Documentation**: Interactive [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar) documentation is automatically generated and served at `/api/reference`. The raw OpenAPI JSON is available at `/api/reference/json`.

- **Progressive Web App Capable**: Meets PWA requirements for an installable, native app-like experience. Scores a near-perfect [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev) report out of the box.

- **Offline Support**: A [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) caches static assets and API responses, enabling offline functionality and faster subsequent loads with fewer requests to the server.

- **Production Ready**: Includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile` that builds the app into a standalone binary and runs it in a minimal distroless image. Pre-configured GitHub workflows for continuous integration and deploying to [fly.io](https://fly.io) on pushes to the `main` branch.

### ðŸš§ Scope

The following are not currently implemented, but may be added in the future:

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / React Server Components (RSC)
- Database / ORM
- Authentication / Authorization
- CSS Framework / UI Component Library
- Unit / E2E Tests
- Logging / Analytics

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

**Setup:**

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation), and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) (optional, but useful for locally testing production builds)

2. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdleveille/fullstack-bun.git
cd fullstack-bun
```

**Local Development:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start dev server
bun dev
```

**Production Build:**

```bash
# Build client-side assets
bun run build

# Compile server into a standalone binary
bun run compile

# Run the compiled server
./main
```

Alternatively, build and run for production in a Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t fullstack-bun .
docker run -p 3000:3000 fullstack-bun
```
