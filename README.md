## âœ¨ Features

- **100% Type-Safe API**: Full static type-safety between the server and client. See [api.ts](https://github.com/cdleveille/fullstack-bun/blob/main/src/server/api.ts) and [useApi.ts](https://github.com/cdleveille/fullstack-bun/blob/main/src/client/hooks/useApi.ts) for simple HTTP and WebSocket examples.

- **Automatic API Documentation**: Interactive [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar) documentation is automatically generated and served at `/api/reference`. The raw OpenAPI JSON is available at `/api/reference/json`.

- **Progressive Web App Capable**: Meets PWA requirements for an installable, native app-like experience. Scores a near-perfect [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev) report out of the box.

- **Offline Support**: A [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) caches static assets and API responses, enabling offline functionality and faster subsequent loads with fewer requests to the server.

- **Production Ready**: Includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile` that compiles the app into a standalone binary and runs it in a minimal distroless image. Pre-configured GitHub workflows for continuous integration and deploying to [fly.io](https://fly.io) on pushes to the `main` branch.

## ðŸš§ Scope

The following are not currently implemented, but may be added in the future:

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / React Server Components (RSC)
- Database / ORM
- Authentication / Authorization
- CSS Framework / UI Component Library
- Unit / E2E Tests
- Logging / Analytics

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Setup

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation), and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) (optional, but useful for locally testing production builds)

2. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdleveille/fullstack-bun.git
cd fullstack-bun
```

### Local Development

Install dependencies and start development server:

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

### Production Build

**Option 1:** Bundle client and start server:

```bash
bun bundle
bun start
```

**Option 2:** Build app and run standalone binary:

```bash
bun run build
./main
```

**Option 3:** Build Docker image and run in container:

```bash
docker build -t fullstack-bun .
docker run -p 3000:3000 fullstack-bun
```
